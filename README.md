# ComicBookApp v1.1

## Upgrades
● Atomic Design Refactor
● React Router for changing views 

## Description

It's an app made in ReactJS which has 2 views:

● Show a list of the last comics (grid/list view mode)

● Show a detail of the selected comic

I consume the restful API of Comic Vine which is the largest comic database online. Here is the API documentation:
https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/documentation

made a gh-pages deployment too: https://mikevitamina.github.io/ComicBookApp/ , however, i got some CORS policy trouble with the API. In order to see it working on your browser you should need a CORS proxy. I have used a Chrome Plugin call 'CORS Unblock':
